# twatter

`twatter` is an implementation of Twitter login flow.


## gmail

so this has integration with gmail, but after running it for some time I found out that it is not the best way to do things.
if you need to automate email code retriaval, it would be much better to setup your own mail server, then for each twitter
account you have setup forwarding to that email address. I might add better support for that in the future.


## note

this project's purpose is educational only. please don't use `twatter` to circumvent obtaining Twitter API keys
